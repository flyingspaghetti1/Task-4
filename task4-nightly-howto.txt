I made a file with my password in it so i don't have to introduce it manually when using sudo:

password="passfile"

update_system() {
    log "Updating package lists..."
    sudo -S apt update < "$password" -y
    log "exit code $?"

    log "Upgrading installed packages..."
    sudo -S apt upgrade < "$password" -y
    log "exit code $?"

    log "Cleaning up..."
    sudo -S apt autoremove < "$password" -y
    log "exit code $?"
}

Then i used a cron job to run it nightly at 1AM:

$ crontab -e
crontab: installing new crontab
$ crontab -l
# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
0 1 * * * ~/Desktop/up.sh
